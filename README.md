# CODSOFT-To-Do-List
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing  users to create, update, and track their to-do lists

# To-Do List Application

A simple graphical To-Do List application built using Python's `tkinter` library. This application allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks from the list.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task by typing into the entry field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
- **Complete Task**: Users can mark a selected task as completed, which will append "[Completed]" to the task in the list.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete a selected task from the list.
- **Task Validation**: The application ensures that tasks are not added if the input is empty and prevents actions like completing or deleting a task without a selection.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (It is included in standard Python installations, but ensure it is available)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `todo.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. No additional dependencies are required beyond `tkinter`.

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python todo.py

**Usage**

- Type a task into the entry field.
- Click "Add Task" to add it to the task list.
- Select a task and click "Complete Task" to mark it as completed.
- Select a task and click "Delete Task" to remove it from the list.
